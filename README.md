  BloomBus is an initiative to build a system for tracking and displaying the
  locations of shuttle buses owned and run by Bloomsburg University (and the
  C.G.A.) across the several loops that they run.

# What is BloomBus?

## History of BloomBus

BloomBus began as a student project through the Bloomsburg University ACM student chapter with a student, Dan Pany, who had the idea for the hardware that the tracking system would be based upon. He envisioned connecting an Adafruit GPS module to an Arduino microcontroller, in addition to an XBee radio transmitter, and using the 3 in tandem to receive GPS data, parse GPS data, and transmit GPS data \(respectively\). This system would also involve an XBee radio receiver connected over a USB connector to a server that would receive the GPS data, then upload it in a particular format onto a real-time database \(Google's Firebase\).

Another student, Rio Weber, began working with Pany on the BloomBus project primarily acting as the applications developer to provide the real-time database and user-facing application that displays the shuttles' coordinates. The 2 students conducted an independent study within the Digital Forensics program to work on a functioning prototype for this system. Their work is thoroughly documented in the documetn found here

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
