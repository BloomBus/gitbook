# Trello

A Trello board for this project can be found at [https://trello.com/b/FVg1GwEZ/bloombus](https://trello.com/b/FVg1GwEZ/bloombus) \(must be a member of the board to view\).  
  
This is how the Trello board is organized:  
The leftmost lists represent major groups of related features that either make up a component of the projects \(e.g. the ETAs component\) or a stage of the project \(the Minimum Viable Product\).

When work on one of those major groups is started, cards from those groups can be incorporated into the backlog or groomed backlog depending on whether there are additional details to be worked out on the cards.

The backlog \(not groomed backlog\) also can hold cards that do not necessarily belong to a major group, but are not ready to be claimed for work. 

Cards in the groomed backlog are ready to be claimed by any developer to start work, and at that point should be moved to In Progress, and that developer should mark themselves as the Owner of that card.

Once work is completed on a card, it can be moved to the Done list.

 If a card is no longer needed, it can either be archived, or if it should be kept around to mark a major decision on the direction of the project, it could be moved to the Cancelled list.
